**Piano Trainer ðŸŽ¹**

Piano Trainer is an Android app designed to help piano learners practice more efficiently, track their progress, and explore interactive tools like a virtual piano and metronome. It combines structured practice sessions, statistics tracking, and learning resources in a single mobile app.

**ðŸ§  Project Concept**

The idea behind Piano Trainer is to provide a digital companion for piano learners. Practicing an instrument requires discipline, repetition, and monitoring progress. Many beginners struggle to maintain consistent practice and track improvement. This app solves these problems by:

	Providing a practice timer with automatic record saving.

	Logging practice sessions and calculating statistics (total time and unique pieces).

	Offering interactive tools like a virtual piano and metronome.

	Including learning resources, such as curated finger tutorials.

The app is lightweight, intuitive, and designed to make practice sessions both productive and enjoyable. Users can add their own sheet music, resume previous sessions, and see their improvement over time.

**ðŸ“¦ Features**

Practice Menu

	Select existing pieces or add new ones.

	Start timed practice sessions.

	Resume recent sessions easily.
**	Practice Sub-Menu**

The Practice sub-menu is designed to organize all the practice-related functionality in one place, improving workflow and user experience. It serves as a gateway to the core practice features, including:

	Add Piece

		Allows the user to add new sheet music or select from existing pieces.

		Users can search and filter the list for quick selection.

	Start Practice

		Opens the practice session activity for the selected piece.

		Displays the sheet music and starts a timer.

	View Statistics

		Opens a summary of practice history: total time spent, number of unique pieces, and recent sessions.

	Recent Practice

		Shows the most recent practice sessions for quick access.

		Clicking a recent session opens that piece in a new practice session.

	Back Button

		Returns to the main menu.

This submenu ensures all practice functions are grouped logically, making navigation smooth and consistent.

	Simulates real piano keys for practice without a physical instrument.

**ðŸ›  Installation & Running**

	Place any additional sheet music images in res/drawable/.

	Build and run the app on a physical device or emulator.
